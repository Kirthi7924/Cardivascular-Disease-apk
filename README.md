## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: v4.2+ (for development)
- **Java JDK**: 8 or above
- **Firebase**: Setup for cloud storage
- **Google Colab**: For training and exporting machine learning models
- **Python**: v3.8+ (for model training with TensorFlow and scikit-learn)
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For model deployment on mobile
- **Git**: For version control

### Steps
1. **Clone Repository**  

2.  **Setup Firebase**
    
    -   Create a Firebase project.
    -   Download `google-services.json` and place it in the `app/` directory.
    -   Enable Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Storage in your Firebase Console.
3.  **Run Machine Learning Model**
    
    -   Open the model training notebook in Google Colab.
    -   Install dependencies:
        
        `pip install scikit-learn tensorflow` 
        
    -   Train the model and export it as `.tflite`.
    -   Place the exported model in the Android project's `assets/` folder.
4.  **Build & Run the App**
    
    -   Open the project in Android Studio.
    -   Sync Gradle and run the app on an Android device or emulator.
